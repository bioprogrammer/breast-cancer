Cancer is a complex series of diseases distinguished by cell type, location, stage, and grade, but, by definition it is defined by cellular growth that, through a complex series of mechanisms, seeks to evade the innate defenses of the immune system, and in the case of a malignancy, proliferate throughout the body effectively disrupting the homeostatic physiology of organ systems and introducing the possibility of death to the affecte organism or individual. There exist two forms of abnormal cell growth, one of which is erroneously referred to as 'cancer', that exhibit distinct differences in both appearance and behavior.
