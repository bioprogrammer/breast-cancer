Cancer is a complex series of diseases distinguished by cell type, location, stage, and grade, but, by definition it is defined by cellular growth that, through a complex series of mechanisms, seeks to evade the innate defenses of the immune system, and in the case of a malignancy, proliferate throughout the body effectively disrupting the homeostatic physiology of organ systems and introducing the possibility of death to the affecte organism or individual. There exist two forms of abnormal cell growth, one of which is erroneously referred to as 'cancer', that exhibit distinct differences in both appearance and behavior:

<center>
  
|Trait|Benign|Malignant|
|-----|------|---------|
|Nuclear size|Small|Large|
|N/C ratio (ratio of nuclear size to cytoplasmic volume)|Low|High|
|Nuclear shape|Regular|Pleomorphic (irregular shape)|
|Mitotic index|Low|High|
|Tissue Organization|Normal|Disorganized|
|Differentiation|Well differentiated|Poorly differentiated (anaplastic)|
|Tumor Boundary|Well defined ("encapsulated")|Poorly defined|

In order to classify tissue biopsy samples into a predicted category, this project will utilize the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset which consists of the following attributes:

**Attribute Information:**

1.) ID number

2.) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)


3-32.)


**Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:**


a.) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

b.) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

c.) perimeter

d.) area

e.) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

f.) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

g.) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

h.) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

i.) symmetry

j.) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
